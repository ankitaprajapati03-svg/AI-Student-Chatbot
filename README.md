# AI Chatbot for Student Support Services using Python and Machine Learning

The AI Chatbot for Student Support Services is an intelligent virtual assistant that helps students by answering frequently asked questions related to academics, admissions, fees, examinations, placements, library, hostel, scholarships, and college events.

Instead of waiting for office hours or contacting staff, students can ask questions at any time through the chatbot. The chatbot understands user questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and provides relevant responses instantly.

This project reduces the workload of college staff while improving student support.

## Chatbot Features
- Ask questions in simple English.
- Understand different ways of asking the same question.
- Answer frequently asked student questions
- Intent prediction using Machine Learning
- Greeting messages.
- Thank you and goodbye responses.
- Handle unknown questions politely.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- SQLite
- Pandas
- NumPy
